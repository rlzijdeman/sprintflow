# sprintflow
*To handle/monitor the incoming and outgoing workflow.*

A pool of incoming work is saved in `treasure hoard` (backlog).
You can add work to my treasure hoard via a pull request.

Each week I dedicate myself to a `captain's starlog` (milestone).
A milestone is reached when I have completed a specified set of tasks from the treasure hoard and an unknown number of charges. `Charges` are requests coming in during the week that require immediate attention.

The workload is set such that I'll be able to reach the milestone 90% of the time. 
Success is reported weekly to my manager. 
Failure is reported weekly to my manager with a request for (sprint)review. Is it my speed, too many charges, or too much ambition in the task set?

NB: written today, Mar 30, 2020. Let's see whether I can get 4 of these reports in! :P
