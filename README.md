# sprintflow
Purpose: To handle/monitor the incoming and outgoing workflow.
A pool of incoming work is saved in 'treasure hoard' (backlog). You can add work to my treasure hoard via a pull request.
Each week I dedicate myself to a milestone.
A milestone is reached when I have completed a specified set of tasks from the treasure hoard and an unknown number of charges. 
Charges are requests coming in during the week that require immediate attention.

The workload is set such that I'll be able to reach the milestone 90% of the time. Success is reported weekly to my manager. Failure is reported as well, but requires also a review. Is it my speed, too many charges, or too much ambition in the task set?

NB: written today, Mar 30, 2020. Let's see whether I can get in 4 of these reports :P
